## ⚠️ Current Technical Status & Required Actions

### 🚨 CRITICAL UPDATES NEEDED (Before Deployment)

**Status**: Phases 1-4 restructuring complete, but file path updates required

1. **File Reference Updates** (HIGH PRIORITY)
   - `public/app.js` needs data file path updates:
     - `practice-data.json` → `../data/practice/practice-data.json`
     - `interview-questions.json` → `../data/questions/interview-questions.json`
   - All JSON file references need updating

2. **Configuration Updates** (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
