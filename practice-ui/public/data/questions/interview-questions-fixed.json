          "difficulty": "Medium",
          "experienceLevel": ["0-2", "3-5"],
          "answer": "== compares references (memory addresses) while .equals() compares object content. For primitives, == compares values. String literals with same value may share memory (interning), but new String() creates new objects.",

          "experienceLevel": ["0-2", "3-5"],
          "answer": "String is immutable - creates new objects on modification. StringBuilder is mutable and not thread-safe, best for single-threaded string building. StringBuffer is mutable and thread-safe but slower due to synchronization.",

          "difficulty": "Medium",
          "experienceLevel": ["0-2", "3-5"],
          "answer": "Exception handling manages runtime errors using try-catch-finally blocks. Checked exceptions (compile-time) must be caught or declared (IOException, SQLException).

          "answer": "Collections framework provides data structures. List allows duplicates and maintains order (ArrayList, LinkedList). Set doesn't allow duplicates (HashSet, TreeSet).
